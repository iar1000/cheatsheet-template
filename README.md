# Cheatsheet - Template

Extended version of the cheatsheet, with personal comments and notes, can be compiled setting `\toggletrue{showcomments}`. Use the `comment` environment to add stuff that not necessarily needs to be on the final cheatsheet.  
A short version compiles to A4-pages of the most important concepts and formulas (everything not in `comment` environment), use `\togglefalse{showcomments}` for this.  

Feel welcomed to create PR's with corrections or improvements!
